# website
Welcome to the website of my "art museum".
The museum itself is kinda fictitious, except now it has a website, with
some things that could maybe pass for art on it. 

Let me know if you find any bugs with the image enlarge feature or navigation image effects,
especially the subtitles in the gallery page.

Also let me know if there's a glaringly obvious page an art museum should have that I forgot about.
I think a gallery, gift shop, and contact info cover all the basics but I have been known to forget things.

That's about it
