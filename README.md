# website
Welcome to the website of my "art museum".
The museum itself is kinda fictitious, except now it has a website, with some things that could maybe pass for art on it. 
It has a minimalist style to mimic modern art museum websites, featuring art for website navigation.
...but since my art is rather goofy the website ended up being a bit goofy too. (I see this as a good thing, and wrote humorous website text to match)

The plan for this site was to be a simple place for me to dump digital art, maybe to show my friends but at least so I can access it more easily since my computer's file organization is a mess.
