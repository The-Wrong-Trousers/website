I'm planning to dump most of the artwork I've made over the years on here,
and then maybe design some (currently fake) merchandise based off it.
I've been having a lot of trouble selecting a style for the site because
there's quite a few ideas I like, but none of them feel quite right.
A serious art-gallery type look would be funny considering the style of 
art I make, but a more fun brightly colored design would actually match
the contents of the site.
